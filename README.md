# TODO

* print out check points. Once it asks you a lot of questions,
  it might be easier to just print out the full command line that
  you could write next time instead
* Display some jokes about taxes while waiting for tax calculation
* Give example benefits. Then you can do the special calculation for a car value or look up the specific mobile phone offers
* finish the remaining inputs
* make it possible to run this for the remainder of the year, rather than the whole year
* visualizations in html
* model how the dividents add up over time
* add validation to make sure you don't specify that you pay yourself more
  than the company makes
